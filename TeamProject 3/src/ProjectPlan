Put your initials above to steps that you want to complete.

Step 1: Main Method 
	- Should declare all variables
	- Read and write data to two seperate files
	- The first item in the input file contains a integer value
		- The rest of the values are double values
	- use an If/else/if construct and the scale below to calculate the mileage
		- only if the input value is > 0
	- Output the results to the output file
		- (Full formatting guide on onedrive file)
		
Step 2: 
	- explain the program to the user (using a method)
	
Step 3:
	- A method using mileage array as a parameter 
		- reads the mileage values from the input file (?)
			- use the same approach as project 1 for reading a file
		- stores them in the mileage array
		- Performs NO calculation
		
Step 4: 
	- Method with parameters of two arrays and an integer 
	- calculates the array of reimbursement amounts (one of the parameters)
		- if the mileage value is negative or 0, the corresponding reimbursement amount should be zero. 
		
Step 5: 2 methods
	- Method that prints the headings for the output file
	- Method that prints the contents of two arrays in the output file
		- each detail line of the table contais the number of miles and the reimbursement amount
		- if the input value is <= 0, output five stars '*****'
		- format using leftPad
		
Step 6:
	- use a method or methods to calculate:
		- average reimbursement 
		- average number of miles traveled 
			- These averages will be the averages for miles > 0. 
		- Also, output total milage values that are > 0, and the two averages calculated.
